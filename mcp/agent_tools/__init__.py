"""
Agent helper tools package.

This package is a placeholder for future agent helper tools that can assist
with inter-agent communication, data persistence, and workflow coordination.

Example tools that could be added:
- save_array/load_array: Save/load numpy arrays between agent runs
- save_dict/load_dict: Save/load dictionaries with mixed data types
- list_agent_files: List files available for agents to use

For now, this package is empty but structured to allow easy addition of tools.
